# Baking-App
Android App built from scratch to be submitted as the third project at Udacity Android Nanodegree program that allow the users to select a recipe and see its ingredients video-guided steps for how to complete it.

# Why this project ?

In this project i've learned:
 * Using Exoplayer to display videos.
 * Handling error cases in Android.
 * Adding a widget to your app experience.
 * Using a third-party library in your app.
 * Using Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
